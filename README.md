## 📌 Summary

I'm an AI researcher and consultant working at the intersection of **biomedical data**, **explainability**, and **rare disease modeling**.  
My work spans from gait analysis in Parkinson and HSP to web-based applications for clinical decision support, combining **interpretable AI**, **deep learning**, and **generative techniques** for low-resource datasets.

Let’s build AI tools that clinicians can actually understand and use.
